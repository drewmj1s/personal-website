        <p style={{color: '#000', marginLeft: '10%', marginRight: '10%'}}>I'm Andrew, a recent graduate from Radford
            University
            with a B.S. in Computer Science. I've been interested in software engineering for about 5 years, and
            with each year that has passed I feel like I have 'leveled up' my ability to develop fast, attractive and
            secure software. <b>Below I have highlighted some of my recent projects.</b></p>
        <br/>
        <p style={{color: '#000', marginLeft: '10%', marginRight: '10%'}}>My admiration for computers and good software
            leaks into my hobbies
            which includes video games, listening to and making music and working on personal projects where I find
            time.</p>
